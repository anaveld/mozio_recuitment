# Description

Mozio recruitment task.

I tried to follow the steps from the email you gave me. 
What I was able to acomplish:
* app is working according to specification - it uses PostGIS database add-on to store and search for geographical data. Search time is very fast
* create AWS infrastructure based on ECS and Fargate
* have self-describing Django rest framework documentation


Where I missed more time:
* test coverage is very poor. There are no test cases for views to make sure that API works without any flaws (I've only tested it manually)
* AWS infrastructure is not working correctly. While 95% of it is well put together I'm missing some port routing issue or security and I can't access Django app inside container


# Conclusions

I'm not happy with the overall solution, however the app is working according to requirements and it's using designated technology to fulfill given task. I'm happy to hop on a call with technical recruiter to have conversation about the solution. I'm also happy to show AWS infra on a call.
